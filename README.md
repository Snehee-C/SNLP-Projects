# SNLP-Projects
Projects undertaken during the course SNLP i.e Speech and Natural Language Processing

Datasets used:

Assignment 1 : Text Classifier and Text preprocessing (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/data).

Assignment 2 : Bag of Words, Words2Vec,SkipGram (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/data).

Assignment 3: Part 1: Uses same IMDB Dataset to do RNN and LSTM using Pytorch.

Assignment 3: Part 2: Uses dateparser_testcases.csv (uploaded) to do dateparsing without any libraries using regex, etc.          

Assignment 5: Finetuning Transformers on IMDB Dataset.

Assignment 6: Part 1: Using Stanford Question Answering Dataset to make q&a model with token level IoU metric (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stanfordu/stanford-question-answering-dataset).

Assignment 6: Part 2: NER and DeBerta model on The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data/overview).

Assignment 7: Part 1: Match unresolved queries with already resolved queries using Fuzzy Search and BoW + Tfidf with cosine similarity for the same.

Assignment 7: Part 2: Match names between 2 lists.

Assignment 8: Sematic Search by training a bi-encoder using Cosine Similarity Loss, Contrastive Loss, Multiple Negative Ranking Loss and training a cross-encoder (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-question-pairs/overview)

Assignment 9: Topic Modelling using LSA, LDA, NMF and BERTopic (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/nips-papers/data)
